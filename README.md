Sign Language to Speech Conversion Glove

A low-cost wearable assistive device to convert finger gestures into audible speech in real-time.

This project bridges the communication gap between speech- and hearing-impaired individuals and society by translating hand-based sign gestures into speech output using flex sensors and audio playback.

No AI/ML used â€” pure hardware-based real-time gesture-to-speech solution.
